a) Implement perceiver ml model for classification in keras. Use it to classify some simple image dataset.
   - Performed on the Cifar-100 dataset. Classified 15 classes from the dataset.


b) Use Perceiver IO model code in a colab for an interesting ML task.
 - Performed video autoencoding task on the UCF101 dataset
