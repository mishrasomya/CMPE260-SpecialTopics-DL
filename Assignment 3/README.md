1. Implemented five fine-tuning tasks:

    a. **Grammatical Sentence Classification**: fine-tuned a nnlm-en-dim50 model on CoLA dataset

    b. **Question Answering:** fine-tuned a DistilBERT model on SQuAD dataset

    c. **Entailment:** fine-tuned a BERT model on SNLI dataset

    d. **Named-entity recognition (NER):** fine-tuned a German BERT model on German legal named entity dataset

    e. **Sentiment Classification:** fine-tuned a nnlm-en-dim50 model on IMDB reviews sentiment dataset
  
2. Embedded Gradio app to be able to test the data
3. Integrated Tensorboard in each colab
4. Included screenshots for Tensorboard and Gradio for each fine-tuning task
